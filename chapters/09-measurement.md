# Measurement

## Introduction
**In this section you can learn**
- Why do we measure - benefits for us and clients
- What is KPI and examples for various projects
- What tools to use
- Process explained

From Cambridge Dictionary:
<BaseQuote
  text="Measure - to judge the quality, effect, importance, or value of something"

The goal of measuring performance of designs is to know precisely, having data as evidence, if they perform well or bad, and how well exactly? In a nutshell you should measure something at one point in time, then change/adjust/redesign it and take the measure again. Difference between these two measurements is your impact. Doing that, we will be able learn which solutions work best, and clients will be able to get these solution, so it’s win-win scenario.

Before proceeding with measurements, talk to your client about it, explain how vastly it will benefit quality of product and be sure to have client’s permission to access or install analytics tools.

### KPI

Key Performance Indicators, also known as KPIs, are quantifiable measurements that help define and track the progress toward goals.

## Benefits for us:
- We’ll be able learn which UX/UI solutions work best in real world with real users
- Working on a long-term project gives us an opportunity to get deeper knowledge and become an expert in the particular PD field. Our decisions will be more data-driven, less ‘what-i-think-driven’.
- Expanding toolset which could help us providing “the right” solutions
- Create Case Studies - product success based on data
- Gives an opportunity to upsell services like Design Maintenance, Product Check-ups or UX Reviews

## Benefits for clients:
- Client will receive quality consulting service
- Data metrics showing growth may be helpful gaining investors
- Client has dedicated PD expert who tracks the performance and the conversion
- All of decision that will be made, will be data-driven, that means more value - for less money (thanks to the GA access we don’t spend time on experiments)

<table class="dp-table numbered">

    <tr>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>Set KPIs</td>
      <td>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Create a document with list of all KPIs that you want to track,
            this list is called Measurement Plan (see example <a
              href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/18I1hr8s8WafMUXkismoh6pObSoB-2MuxBoycO3rWzJE/edit#heading=h.o6o8gag6ilc3"
              target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>).
            Different products require different KPIs, for example, on landing
            page it’s good when users spend more time on them (better
            engagement) whereas in SaaS product, where users are task oriented,
            the less time they spend accomplishing a task, the better (indicates
            good UX). See example KPIs below in the table.
          </li>
          <li>
            Choose analytic tool(s) that are able to track these KPIs.
            Google Analytics is a must-have, Hotjar is highly recommended.

          <li>If you want to use funnels in GA, you have to setup it now (non
            retroactive), before gathering data. In Hotjar they can be setup
            anytime (retroactive)</li>
          <li>For convenience you can create Custom Reports in GA, so data that
            interests you will be visible straight away without a need to adjust
            view’s filters/timeframes every time you visit GA</li>

          <li>If you have some hypothesis but need more data - offer qualitative
            research method e.g. interviews, surveys (Hotjar)</li>
          <li>Propose design adjustments that will clearly improve product’s
            performance</li>
          <li>Move towards creating case study - Success Based on Data</li>
        </ul>
      </td>
    </tr>

## KPI Examples:

**SaaS**

- Time on task (less = better)
- Customer Support e.g. number of requests from Intercom (less = better)
- Use of search vs. navigation (less search = better)
- Average session duration (less = better)

**Landing page**

- Conversion rate: Signup form -> App (more = better)
- Bounce rate (less = better)
- Average session duration (longer = better)
- Signup form abandonment rate (less = better)

**Mobile App (only GA in native apps)**

- Average Revenue Per User
- Average session duration (longer = better)
- App Launch / Load Time (shorter = better)
- Exit rate (less = better)
- Session Interval (shorter = better)

**eCommerce**

- Customer lifetime value (higher = better)
- Conversion: Product page -> Purchase (more = better)
- Cart abandonment rate (less = better)

## Desired outcome after this stage
- Data reports
- Conclusions after analyzing data
- Case study - Success Based on Data
- Selling additional service: Product Design, Product Check-up, Design maintenance
