# Discovery

This is the stage where many questions will arise, and conducting thorough research will help answer most of them early as well as bring benefits in the later stages. Not only will research save your time, but it will also give a deep insight into and a better understanding of the productâ€™s specifics. The client, on the other hand, will benefit from the research too, because challenging the client with the right questions helps them crystallize their vision and may lead to some substantial changes.

Research takes time and can cost money, but in the grand scheme of things it will save time and money by helping to focus on the direction of the design process. It also helps you justify to your client the communication solutions you put forward. **Remember that all research must be carefully documented and information sources need to be saved and made available for future reference.**
