- Specific design states and how to prepare one
- Tips for designing for a specific device
- Best practices for working in teams
- Where to find design resources
- Sketch tips

We design something to give form to a function – to solve a problem with a set of available resources. Good design is solving a problem so that it seems as if there had never been a problem in the first place. Well designed interfaces, communication processes, or objects shouldn’t require too much effort from their users. Good design often makes you think: Gosh, I could have done that myself!
And yes, well-designed things are often a pleasure to look at or experience. In some cases, the form will precede the function.

## Inspiration
**Find an accurate style for the project**
Remember that the inspiration process is really important when you start designing a new project. The overall feeling of an application/website depends on which colors, fonts or photos you use. **Remember: Do not copy, just get inspired!**

You can look for inspiration here:
- [Awwwards](http://www.awwwards.com)
- [Dribbble](http://www.dribbble.com)
- [Behance](http://www.behance.com)
- [Designspiration](http://www.designspiration.net)
- [Pinterest] (http://www.pinterest.com) 

### Preparing moodboards
This step is really important for you and your client. There are situations when you finish your design, and the client is really happy – but this is not always the case. We recommend that you prepare a board with a lot of photos and pictures that will show your client what you would like to do with the future app, what “feelings” your designs will evoke, and finally, what the client can expect. Thanks to this approach you will increase the chances that client likes your solutions, and you will show that you care about the client’s feedback. **Approximate time: 4h**

**Examples of moodboards:**

**How to prepare a moodboard?**
Use Boards by InVision for the following reasons:
- Flexibility 
- Predefined layouts
- Option to add images, fonts and attachments

## Style guide
It’s good to create a style guide right after the research stage. The initial version should at least contain the colors and typography. During the visual design phase, you should update your style guide to a full version.

**What should a good style guide contain?**
- **Color** (main colors and shade variations for each of them)
Inspirations:

- **Typography** (font family and type scale)
Limit the number of typefaces and sizes you use in order to keep your designs simple. As a general rule of thumb, start with two fonts at most – one for your headers, and another one for your bodies. Most of the time, you won’t need any more than that.
We highly recommend using free fonts. If you want to use a paid font, check the licence carefully. If we use paid fonts, we charge clients. We can buy fonts for them and bill them – make sure the client agrees before that happens.
Free fonts: [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
Paid fonts: [MyFonts](http://www.myfonts.com/) and [Typekit](https://typekit.com/)

- **Component library** (states of design)
Component-based thinking helps engineers. Design components can translate neatly into code. From the engineering perspective, components are like Lego blocks that you can put together.
For example:
  - Buttons (normal, hover, active, disabled)
  - Inputs (empty, selected, typing, error, success)
- **Grids and spacing**
It’s important to establish a grid system that works for every use case. In the section on grids, include information on the number of columns and rows, margins, and example uses.

## States of design
During the design process, you have to keep in mind that your UI can be in different states:
**1. Nothing**
Maybe it’s the first time a user sees view, interface element or status. Maybe it’s not activated yet. Essentially, the component exists but hasn’t started.
**2. Loading**
The dreaded state. In a perfect world, no one would ever see this. Alas, here we find ourselves. There are plenty of ways to keep your loading state subtle and unobtrusive.
**3. None**
Your component has initialized, but it’s empty. No data. No Items. Now may be a good time to get the user to act (“Do this!”), or to reward them (“Good job, everything has been taken care of”).
**4. One**
You have some data. On an input, this may be after the first keystroke. In a list, it might be when you have one item (or one left).
**5. Some**
This is usually what you think of first. What is the ideal state for this component? Your data is loaded, you have input, and the user is familiar with it.
**6. Too many**
The user has overdone it in some way. Too many results (maybe you paginate them now), too many characters (maybe ellipses?), and so on.
**7. Incorrect**
Something is not right about the component. An error has occurred.
**8. Correct**
This item has had its requirements satisfied.
**9. Done**
The user’s correct input has been received by the application. The user doesn’t have to worry about it anymore.

These states will recur based on the page, user interaction, updated data, and pretty much any change to your application’s state. By thoughtfully designing for these changes, you can create a polished experience for users no matter which situation they find themselves in.

## Designing specifics for mobile native apps
If you are only starting to design native apps, the best thing is to read the official guidelines for the Android (Material Design) and for iOS (Human Interface Guidelines) operation systems.

**Apple’s iPhones**

Designing for gestures in general
Use the most popular gestures to make application even more interactive. Remember that while using your phone, there is no “right click” as is the case with browsing websites on a computer. Try to put the most popular and intuitive finger gestures in areas where users might expect them.
