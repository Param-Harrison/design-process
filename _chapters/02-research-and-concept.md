- Elements of research.
- Elements of a concept.
- How much time to spend on the research & concept.
- Questions most frequently asked by clients.

The Research & Concept phase is the very foundation of our design process. It is crucial for the proper understanding and fulfilment of human needs behind the developed product. This is the time when the big requirements are agreed upon and a direction is chosen. This is also the moment when the initial idea is developed into a basic draft/prototype. The main goal of our design process is not just to create pretty pictures or satisfy the subjective feelings of various stakeholders – our main goal is to fit both client's business goals with user's goals by delivering accessible, usable and attractive product. We want to make a product that not only looks great, but, more importantly, also works great and seamlessly meets (or even exceeds) end users’ expectations.

In order to deliver a great product, much effort needs to be taken, and Research & Concept marks the first major milestone in this process. This is the stage where many questions will arise, and conducting a thorough research will help answer most of them early and benefit the latter stages. Not only will it save us time, but it will also give the Product Design team a deep insight into and a better understanding of the product specifics. The client, on the other, hand will benefit from it too, because challenging a client with the right questions helps them crystallize their vision and may lead to some substantial changes.

#### Benefits: why is it a good idea to do research in a team?
When doing research together, a team generate ideas faster and verify their ideas in the context of the product. Working in a group also gives you a chance to use the so-called mutual design critique (when one designer contests the ideas of another designer) – this technique enables you to see drawbacks in your thinking process and lets you get visual inspirations from others.

#### What are the benefits of Research & Concept?
**Benefits for a Product Designer:**
- You build a strong foundation for future design processes.
- You don’t waste time on finding the right look for your project during the wireframing and designing phases.
- A concept document lays a good basis for the communication with the client about the style, visuals, etc. at later parts of the design process. For example, you can show the client that you agreed on something earlier in case the client tries to change previous agreements.
- The client’s trust in you – a solid concept and research is a foundation for a good mutual relationship, because you prove you understand their product.
- Having a wider vision of the product in relation to the market, cultural and user's context.
- Moreover, visual concepts help to gather and create assumptions that can be easily understood by the client and that can be later verified with the end user.

**Benefits for the client:**
- A solid research raises chances for product success because whole development is built on data about the market, culture and competitors.
- The concept helps the client get a new perspective on their product.
- The client can see how the product fits the market.
- At the beginning of the design stage, the client will know the whole spectrum of possible solutions and will be able to find the best one.
- The client can share the results of our work internally and externally (for example with investors).
- A better understanding of the market.
- Review of direct competitors: their flaws and merits.
- An insight into the potential obstacles and pitfalls that they should avoid.
- Information about end users’ expectations.
- An informed competitive advantage.
- The wireframing phase will be easier and faster to conduct (recommendations, etc.).

## Research
The most obvious type of research is to query the internet. Don’t hesitate to have a small brainstorming session on paper as well. You can use some powerful exercises such as: 5 whys, or questions from the UX Review or Product Design Sprint.

### Elements of design research:
- Literature review (collecting and reviewing all existing materials relevant to your subject, e.g. academic articles, Google search)
- Collecting details (existing materials, corporate guidelines) of your client’s business and the services the client offers
- Information on the target customer base. (What do they want, need, and expect?)
- Analysis of competitors (Who are they? How are they different? How are they similar? How do they advertise or make information available?)
- Estimates and technical advice from subcontractors (e.g. printing facilities)

### Things to consider:
- Is a full design audit required? Much like a SWOT analysis, which assesses strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, a design audit applies the same stringent methodology to analyzing the competitors’ visual presence in the marketplace. Maybe you can offer a Product Design Sprint?

{% include quote.html text="A graphic design audit is a fantastic and relatively easy way to get a clear picture of how your competitors are perceived, what key messages they are communicating and how you look when placed alongside them. It’s also a valuable exercise that informs you about the type of communication your customers are receiving on a regular basis from your key competitors." author="Clare, 2006e" %}

- What are the implications of the audience profile in relationship to the project goals?
- What are the most appropriate means of communicating with this audience (i.e. what media and marketing tools should you use)?
- How do the goals of this project align with your client’s long-term goals?
- Is your client’s message what actually needs to be communicated in order to further the client’s business goals?

Research takes time and can cost money, but in the grand scheme of things, it will save time and money by helping to focus the direction of the design process. It also helps you provide justification for your suggested communication solutions to your client. **Remember that all research must be carefully documented, and information sources need to be saved and made available for future reference.**

### What is the product?
- What is your product’s value proposition?
- What is your desired competitive advantage? What sets apart your product/feature from the competitors?
    - What is the main selling point?

### Business goals are the most important from the client’s perspective
One of the most important aspects of design for both parties is to understand the goals of the product you are designing. Ask the client:
- What are the business goals that you want accomplish?
- What is your business model?
- Are you making any money?
- Do you have an investor or are you bootstrapping?
- Have you conducted market research?
- Do you have a market niche?

Sometimes, very direct questions won’t work the way we want.
- Be smart during the interview with your client, ask them about the things that seem to be important to them.
- Maybe there is a problem that we can solve and measure?
- Be sure to set clear goals of what you want to achieve.
- It’s highly recommended that you review the [Business model canvas.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Business_Model_Canvas.png){:target="_blank"} It’s not a clear example of which questions to ask, but it shows the fundamental aspects of business and products. You can treat it as an inspiration for collecting your thoughts.

Since everything is trackable, speak about the exact points you’re going to track. Identify the client’s KPIs (Key Performance Indicators). Good KPIs take into account the business context, predict success, show early warning signals, and validate achieved results. You can use the following materials to create [tailor-made KPI’s materials.](http://www.bscdesigner.com/kpi-system-example.htm){:target="_blank"} They could range from new sign-ups to a number of customers using Paypal vs. purchases with credit cards. Always make sure you know how high you’re aiming from the start. Sometimes, it can be challenging to analyse.

### Define users/target customer base
Regardless of what you design, it is absolutely obligatory to figure out who you are targeting. Many of us believe that our product is for everyone, but trying to get your product appeal to everyone is going to be painful and expensive. What you want to do is figure out specifically who you are targeting, figure out that niche and focus your efforts on it. Finding out more about your target customer base will help your effectiveness and eventually improve your reach, because once you know who your users are, you’ll know how to design for them.

- Who are the users of your site? (primary and secondary users)
    - How would you describe the users? (user characteristics such as age, experience, education, etc.)
    - Why will they visit the site? (user needs, interests, and goals)
    - When and where will users access the site? (user environment and context)
    - How will users access the site? (user computer settings such as connection speed, resolution, etc.)
- Do you have or are aware of user personas?
- If personas are not provided, write it down and create personas.
- Have you gathered any user feedback?

### Define users’ goals
For a better understanding of your users' needs and goals, we can use job stories. Based on our own empathy and this method, we can discover what users really need and what actions they have to take to achieve their goals. By knowing this, we can build a better [customer journey map](http://boxesandarrows.com/an-introduction-to-user-journeys/){:target="_blank"} that allows users to achieve their goals more quickly. For more information, [go here.](https://blog.intercom.com/using-job-stories-design-features-ui-ux/){:target="_blank"}

- What are the user [stories?](https://www.netguru.co/blog/doing-features-and-user-stories-the){:target="_blank"}
- What are users’ [jobs to be done?](https://blog.intercom.com/using-job-stories-design-features-ui-ux/){:target="_blank"}
- What will users do on the site? (user tasks, content, features and functionality)
- Which tasks are critical to users’ success on the website? (criticality)
- Which tasks are most important to users? (importance)
- Which features of the site will users use the most? (frequency)
- Which features are prone to usability issues? (vulnerability)
- Which tasks are critical to the organization’s success on the website?
- What is the user retention on your website?
- What will make users return to your website?
- What kind of disabilities might your users have?
    - Do they need assistive features?
    - Are there any alternative methods that we can use to deliver the same content?

### Define the competitors
For UX designers, evaluating the competition involves looking at the designs of products that are both in direct and indirect competition. Products that **directly compete** with each other are looking to solve the same problem. They often offer the same core functionalities and have an overlapping user base. **Indirect competitors** either have a different user base or a different service offering, while some aspects of the products overlap.

- Have you benchmarked against your main competitors recently?
- What is your competitor’s mission (if it exists)?
- What are the products/services offered (with pricing)?
- What are the competitor’s strengths (what is the competitor good at?)?
- What are the competitor’s weaknesses (where does the competitor fall short?)?
- What are the key brand differentiators (what are the messaging, product/service offerings, etc. that set the competitor apart from their competition?)?
- What do we share? What are the competitor’s must-haves/must-avoids?

## Concept
### Definition
Concept is the visual and verbal summary of the research process. At this stage of the design process, you’re making a synthesis of everything that you have found about the project, the competition, goals, etc. The result of this stage a potential visual direction formed into a concept.

### What is the goal of making the concept for your project?
The Research and Concept stages are closely related to each other. The concept helps clarify and order the information found during the research. Thanks to this, you can easily determine rough guidelines for the style and form of your project. As a result, it will save you time during the next stages of the design process.

### Setup Project Folder and Start Collecting Moodboards
There are plenty of sites you can use for inspiration :  [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Behance](https://www.behance.net/){:target="_blank"}, [Pttrns](https://pttrns.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Pinterest](https://pl.pinterest.com/){:target="_blank"}, etc. It’s really easy to find similar projects to the one you will be working on. Additionally, there may already be a UI solution to a problem you’re experiencing and trying to solve.
You can save everything you have found on the internet to an Inspirations folder to be able to use it later to create basic moodboards. This folder could be filled with anything: plugins, swatches, or even full case studies from Behance. You can use InVision Moodboards, which is a perfect tool for collecting and sharing inspiration within the team.

### Generating Ideas and Concepts from Concept Mapping
You can use the information in a concept map to generate additional concepts for your project by reorganizing the items on the map.
- Position your design problem as the central idea of your mind map.
- Place circles containing your initial concepts for solving the problem around the central topic.
- Brainstorm related but non-specific concepts and add them as subtopics of these ideas. All related concepts are relevant. At this stage, every conceivable concept is valuable and should not be judged.
- Generate related ideas for each concept you brainstormed in step 3 and add them as subtopics.
- Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you run out of ideas.

### Applying Rhetorical Devices to Concept Mapping
After you have placed all your ideas on the concept map, you can add additional layering to help you refine and explore them further. For example, you can use rhetorical devices to add context to the concepts and make them come alive. Rhetoric is the study of effective communication through the use of the art of persuasion. Design uses many forms of rhetoric — particularly metaphor. If you apply a metaphor-based approach to each idea in your concept map, you will find many new ways to express your message.

### What should the concept include?
#### Verbal (text):
- Executive Summary of the research (short assumptions, disclaimers)
- Suggested tone and voice (if the client’s product didn’t have it earlier)

#### Visual:
- Moodboard
- Inspirations
- Fonts
- Photos
- Patterns
- Mindmap
- Similar case studies
- and so on

**Tip:** Show the results of your work wisely. Sometimes, your client might become inspired by the existing solutions too early, and they will try to impose a style from an existing project. To avoid this problem, you can use specific slices of typography and UI examples that are separated from the context.

### Presentation
You’re doing this because you care about the client’s business – remember about the importance of presentation. Keep it short – present it like a pro, because time is money. Your professional expertise, your knowledge, and your product design experience determine how you should deliver the client’s product to the world. It’s very important to help the client decide what the best solution is. **Don’t go over 5-15 slides – you can attach other materials to an e-mail or a Slack conversation.**

## How much time should Research & Concept take?
Every project has its own unique set of requirements. Irrespective of that, we strongly recommend that you don’t exceed 18 hours when doing Research & Concept: 16 hours for the actual Research & Concept and up to 2 hours for the preparation and presentation of the Research report.

### Q&A
#### Questions your client may ask
{% include qa.html question="Why do you have to spend time researching instead of designing?" answer="Good research is the foundation of every good design. It helps you save money on extra iterations and allows us to design a product that aligns better with the market and real user needs. " %}

{% include qa.html question="How long will it take?" answer="We always want to give you the best output we can provide, so our work needs time. Based on information from you and our own research, we will generate for you the best possible report about your market and your customers. This phase is usually completed after 2 days of work, but in some cases, it could take longer." %}

{% include qa.html question="What is the output of the research phase?" answer="The output of this phase is a short report with information about your target customer base, users' goals and needs, and competitors. You will also get a visual concept with such elements as moodboards, inspirations, photos, mindmaps, etc. All of that will make the foundation for the next stages." %}

{% include qa.html question="We don’t know so much! Does it make sense to continue this project?" answer="This is why we're doing this phase – to know and understand your product and its environment better. After this stage, we can continue working on the project, because we will have laid the foundation for all the following stages." %}

#### Questions to ask yourself at this stage
- Have I conducted the necessary research?
- Has the concept been defined well enough?
- Do I understand the product and its features?
- Do I understand the product’s business goals?
- Has the target customer base been defined?
- Has the competition been analyzed?
- Have user goals been defined?

### Desired outcomes of this stage:
- You conducted research and presented results to the client.
